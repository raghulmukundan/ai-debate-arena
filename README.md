# 🎭 AI Debate Arena

Watch two AI agents debate any topic using **Reflection Patterns** - they critique and improve their own arguments over 3 rounds!

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

This implements the **Reflection Pattern** from Andrew Ng's Agentic AI Course:

1. **🥊 Round 1:** Agents make initial arguments
2. **🔍 Reflection:** Agents critique their own logic, biases, and manipulation tactics
3. **📈 Round 2:** Agents improve arguments based on self-critique
4. **🔍 Reflection:** Second round of self-analysis
5. **🎯 Round 3:** Final polished arguments
6. **⚖️ Verdict:** Judge analyzes the debate

## 🚀 How to Use

**You need an API key:**
- Get free credits at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) ($5 free)
- Or use [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) for GPT models

**Then:**
1. Enter your debate topic
2. Configure Agent Pro and Agent Con (model & API key)
3. Watch them debate and improve in real-time!

## 🎨 Features

- **Multi-Model Support:** Claude vs Claude, Claude vs GPT, or any combination
- **Real-time Streaming:** Watch arguments develop live
- **Split Screen:** Easy side-by-side comparison
- **Full Reflections:** See complete self-critiques (not sanitized!)
- **Verdict Analysis:** AI judge evaluates argument quality

## 🧠 Interesting Discoveries

- AI catches itself making up statistics
- Arguments evolve from emotional to analytical
- By Round 3, agents often ask questions instead of arguing
- Different models show different reasoning styles

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Gradio 4.0+
- **Models:** Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Opus 4, GPT-4o, GPT-4
- **Pattern:** Reflection (Agentic AI)
- **Language:** Python 3.12
